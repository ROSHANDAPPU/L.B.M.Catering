## ⚡ Quick Deployment Path (Recommended)

### The Fastest Way to Get Live:

1. **Read this file** (you're doing it!) - 2 minutes
2. **Read QUICK-START.md** - 3 minutes
3. **Fix image imports** using FIGMA-ASSETS-TO-REPLACE.md - 5 minutes
4. **Push to GitHub** - 2 minutes
5. **Deploy to Vercel** - 1 minute

**Total time: ~10-15 minutes** ⏱️

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Before You Deploy

### You MUST fix Figma asset imports

Your code currently has imports like this:
```typescript
import logo from 'figma:asset/xxxxx.png';
```

These **will not work** outside Figma Make. Your build will fail.

### Two Options:

#### Option 1: Manual Fix (5 minutes)
1. Download logos and business cards from Figma
2. Create `public/images/` folder
3. Place images there
4. Update 4 files (see FIGMA-ASSETS-TO-REPLACE.md)

#### Option 2: Automated Fix (1 minute)
```bash
node fix-imports.js
```

**Don't skip this step!** Your site won't deploy without it.

---

## 🎯 Your Deployment Goal

**Before**: Code sitting in Figma Make  
**After**: Live website at `https://la-bella-mesa-catering.vercel.app`

### What You'll Accomplish:
